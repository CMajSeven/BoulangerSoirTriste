General
-------
78: Fermata placed either on rest after best or on rest on beat depending on player. Replacing with caesura after first eighth note
78: Based on the phrasing, recasting this as a 1+3 measure for beaming and rests

83: librement is written like a tempo marking, but is only in the English Horn part
Flutes
------
19: p only in FS

Oboes
-----
49: Oboe 1 E5 crossed out for C#6
50: Oboe 2 part missing in FS

English Horn
------------
126.4.5: l.v. tie in FS, tie into eighth note of next measure in part

Clarinets
---------
26: Quarter note F crossed out in FS (slur extends over this). Rest in part.
74-77: Clarinet 2 copy slurring/accents from other similar parts.

Bass Clarinet
-------------
Originally written in A transposing down a minor third
11-12: No decrescendo, copying from Clarinet

Bassoons 1 and 2
----------------
107: There is crescendo hairpin continuing from the previous system, but the previous system does not have a hairpin in FS.

Horns 1 and 2
-------------
Originally written with bass clef transposing up a fourth (and treble down a fifth)
7-10: 1 and 2 in part, no indication in FS
41: Horn 2 G in FS, F# in part.
72: Horn 2 F# in FS, explicit F natural in part
77.3: Originally Bb, C#, D# with "do mib fa" (C Eb F) written over
80: Solo is written although all 4 horns are playing
81: F (no accidental) in FS, E in part. Presumably E is correct due to lack of cautionary natural.
83-87: This chord is held 1 measure less in part. 1 measure is crossed out and 1 measure rest added afterwards.
87: Missing flats across line break in FS
96: In part, this whole note is only an eighth note and the next measure is crossed out.

Horns 3 and 4
-------------
Originally written with bass clef transposing up a fourth (and treble down a fifth)
72: Horn 4 F# in FS, explicit F natural in part
80: Solo is written although all 4 horns are playing
80: 8a with extension line is written below the first 2 notes of Horn 4 in FS. 8a without extension line is written below and before the first note in part. Playing this part an octave lower is dubious.
83-88: This chord is held 2 measures less in part. 2 are measures crossed out but only 1 measure rest is added afterwards, leaving 1 measure unaccounted for.
96: In Horn 3 part, this whole note is only a dotted quarter note and the next measure is crossed out.
96-100: Horn 4 part crossed out in part.

Trumpets 1 and 2
----------------
66-70: f en dehors, an octave higher (starting with E5) in part. No dynamic in FS.
153: FS has divisi of B3, E4, B4, but both Trumpets 2 and 3 have B3 in part.

Trumpet 3
---------
161-167: FS has Trumpet 3 col 1, but part has independent part.

Trombones 1 and 2
-----------------
52, 54: Respelling #s to enharmonic equivalents in descending chromatic line
53: Marked marcato in FS.
149-153: FS has bass clef but part has tenor. Bass clef seems unlikely voicing

Trombone 3
----------
52, 54: Respelling #s to enharmonic equivalents in descending chromatic line
161-165: Part has what the Tuba has in FS

Tuba
----
161-165: Part is different from FS

Timpani
-------
78-82: Crossed out in full score
80: Flat missing on Db

Harp
----
Lowest note D# needs tuning
39: Missing clef changes to bass clef on both staves in FS
128: Flat on Db missing in FS
146-152: FS has treble instead of bass clef
162-164: FS has bass clef where it should be treble

---------
6-10: Inconsistent slurring between FS and part
41: No incoming tie after page break in FS
48-49: Div with lower part tremeloing the same melody crossed out
49: sf on beat 3, likely miscopied from violins II
56: Slur over all five notes in FS. 3-2 grouped slurs in part.
59: Slur originally over all five notes, changed to 3 and 2 in FS. 3-2 grouped slurs in part
61: Slurs only in part.
82: "solo" crossed out in part. The staff label in FS is unclear "Von solo [illegible] autres 1o Vs"
97-98: In FS, divisi with only the lower part playing, but this doesn't make much sense with the "mettez vite la sourdine" instruction
118-125: E originally an octave higher and crossed out
125: Originally a dotted  half note tied into an eighth note in next measure, crossed out for half note + quarter rest

Violins II
----------
15: Div. 1 and 2 flipped between FS and part
42: sul G, likely intended for the melody, is impossible to play as the double stop involves the G string.

------
1-2: No dynamics, copying from Violins II
9: No decrescendo, copying from Viols II
35: Legato on div.2 missing in FS
40: Slur missing in FS

118: Cresc only in part
127: Decrescendo only in part

Cellos
------
5: Slur only in FS
6: Decrescendo only in part
42, 44: Black noteheads on the double stops seem to be later additions

165-169: Original part in FS has been crossed, and replaced with the violin lines an octave lower. Original part is largely illegible but has been reconstructed from the trio version.

Basses
------
1-4: No dynamics, copying from other strings
6: No decrescendo in FS, copying from other strings
46: div. not until 48 in FS, 47 in part. Added in afterwards in both.
50: Missing explicit unis in FS
