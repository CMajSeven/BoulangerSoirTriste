11-12: No decrescendo, copying from Clarinet

Bassoons 1 and 2
----------------
107: There is crescendo hairpin continuing from the previous system, but the previous system does not have a hairpin in FS.

-------------
Originally written with bass clef transposing up a fourth (and treble down a fifth)
7-10: 1 and 2 in part, no indication in FS

82: "solo" crossed out in part. The staff label in FS is unclear "Von solo [illegible] autres 1o Vs"
97-98: In FS, divisi with only the lower part playing, but this doesn't make much sense with the "mettez vite la sourdine" instruction
118-125: E originally an octave higher and crossed out
125: Originally a dotted  half note tied into an eighth note in next measure, crossed out for half note + quarter rest

Violins II

35: Legato on div.2 missing in FS
40: Slur missing in FS

6: No decrescendo in FS, copying from other strings
46: div. not until 48 in FS, 47 in part. Added in afterwards in both.
