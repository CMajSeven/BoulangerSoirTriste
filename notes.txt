General
-------
Dagger = Crossed out in FS and crossed out/not present in part
Turned Dagger = Crossed out/not present in FS and crossed out in part
Double Dagger = Crossed out/not present in FS and only in part

78: Fermata placed either on rest after best or on rest on beat depending on player. Replacing with caesura after first eighth note
78: Based on the phrasing, recasting this as a 1+3 measure for grouping
83: librement is written like a tempo marking, but is only in the English Horn part
85: "en récit" around the middle of the measure. Moving to align with Cello Soli
106-111: "un peu serré" and "rit." are seemingly specifically placed but inconsistent across FS and parts
135-143: There is a crescendo to "f mais contenu" over the string section, often contradictory to the dynamics of the individual strings.
153-156: *Different woodwind articulations and dynamics in parts

47-48: Dynamics only in part
50: **Part has F6+A6. FS has D6+F6. ff in part. f in FS. OSSIA PART ONLY

46-48: **This section written in second hand, completely covers illegible original.
48: mf only in part. Slurs only in part. Oboe 2 slur extending into 49 seems dubious
49: *Oboe 1 C#6 originally E5 in FS. It is actually the first 16th B4 of Oboe 2 is crossed out but this makes little sense. The previous measures are completely covering an older version that would likely transition better into an E.
50: **Oboe 2 part missing in FS
58-59: Adding crescendos

126: Hairpins only in part
126.4.5: l.v. tie in FS, tie into eighth note of next measure in part
149: Last 2 beats crossed out by second hand. The next measures contain only whole rests with no signs of erasure, so the continuation is unclear.
153: This measure seems to have been added by a second hand in FS. Whole rest still present
157: Changing dynamic from mf to f to match other woodwinds
164: Adding decrescendo
167: Missing tie from last triplet in FS

96: *The dynamics here are inconsistent between the strings. In FS Violins I and II have sf soutenu, Cellos are unmarked, and Double Basses have a crescendo. In the part, Violin II has an sfp with crescendo (seemingly contradicting "soutenu") and Cellos have p with a crescendo.
97: sf only in FS
97-98: In FS, divisi with only the lower part playing, but this doesn't make much sense with the "mettez vite la sourdine" instruction

122-123: Decrescendo only in FS
124: b on Bb missing in FS
124: ppp only in part
126: *The first note of this measure seems entirely crossed out in FS. Only the 2nd and 3rd division are crossed out in part. The part seems more consistent with the changes in the previous measures.

15: p overwritten with pp in FS. p in part
22: Slur over first 2 notes in FS, all 3 in part
23-24: Respelling Ebs as D#s to agree with Violins I, and G# as Ab to agree with Violins II and prevent confusion in 24

112-116: **In FS, this is originally divided with the written ossia as the upper part and the written upper part as the lower part. However, the lower tremelos appear to be crossed out, and arco is missing if the tremelos were intended. In part, this is changed to how it is written in this edition. A note (second hand) in the FS seems to indicate this change.
117-121: **(Continuing from previous note) In FS, upper divisi seems to have had the quarter note tremolos crossed out and eighth note beams added. Lower tremolos are no longer crossed out. Part continues same manner of playing as previously
